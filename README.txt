# This is a template project for the Farallon Arches new hire homework assignment.  
In this project, you will deploy Arches software in an environment of your choosing, upload this "project and package" into the software, and then build a custom function (in python) that saves spatial information denoting a place or address into a field within a simple Arches resource model.

As part of this homework, please do the following:

1. Fork this repo into your own github account
2. Install Arches (https://github.com/archesproject/arches) and all relevant dependencies in your own environment
3. Install this "project" on top of your Arches installation
4. Write a custom function populates spatial data into the geometry node the provided resource model

Resources:
Arches documentation: https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Expectations:
We expect this exercize to take 4 to 8 hours.  If you find yourself spinning wheels, it's ok.  Becuase Farallon developers function as a unit, we are just as interested in your ability to manage time and reach out for help in a productive manner as we are in assessing your coding chops.
